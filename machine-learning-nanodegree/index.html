    <p>What I learnt as part of a 6 month ML engineering nanodegree with Udacity.</p>

<p><img src="/projects/img/nano_cert.png" /></p>

<p>You can’t move for references to Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence these days. Everyone is at it. From classification of skin cancers through to driverless cars, it making big promises.</p>

<p>After working at a company in operating in this space (although not directly on the ML team), I thought I see what it was all about, and did a six month Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree online through Udacity. I documented what I learnt <a href="https://github.com/morsonluke/ml-course">here</a> along the way. Here’s a few things I learnt…</p>

<h4 id="1-reinforcement-learning-is-difficult-to-get-your-head-around">1. Reinforcement Learning is difficult to get your head around</h4>

<p><strong>What’s it all about?</strong> RL is learning how to map situations to actions to maximise an expected cumulative reward. It’s essentially all about learning while doing but in a heavily mathematical way. One commonly quoted future application of RL is it’s use in self-driving cars however this is obviously yet to fully materialise. It’s sort of like life, I generally want pie and chips for lunch and this would increase my immediate reward through immediate gratification however the long term cumulative reward would not be achieved due to my early death from all the pies.</p>

<h4 id="2-ml-problems-have-been-solved-along-time-ago-under-certain-conditions">2. ML problems have been solved along time ago (under certain conditions)</h4>

<p><strong>What am I on about?</strong> Optical character recognition (OCR) deals with the conversion of images into machine encoded text. There has been a resurgence in interest in OCR in recent years, mainly for digitizing documents to increase the re-usability of data. There are many applications of OCR and under certain conditions, such as with cleanly scanned book images, OCR is close to being a solved problem. OCR engines like Tesseract, which is now open source, have been in development since 1985! There are however a number of interesting challenges where there is still active research such as in character recognition in natural images and handwriting detection. You can see my stab at a bit of OCR <a href="https://github.com/morsonluke/ml-course/blob/master/capstone_project/project_report.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<h4 id="3-ml-is-resource-intensive">3. ML is resource intensive</h4>

<p><strong>And?</strong> To be effective at ML you need to learn more than just the concepts. There’s a lot to learn about development, frameworks and tooling like <a href="https://morsonluke.github.io/projects/ec2-instance-deep-learning/">how to set up up an EC2 instance for ML</a>.</p>

<h4 id="4-the-udacity-6-month-nanodegree-is-a-good-introduction-to-ml">4. The Udacity 6 month nanodegree is a good introduction to ML</h4>

<p><strong>But?</strong> There are lot of concepts to learn and I think the Udacity course provides a great introduction. I especially liked the great feedback given at the end of each project by the reviewers. I do think that it’s something that you would need to be using regularly to really apply along with a strong foundation in mathematics</p>
